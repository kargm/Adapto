    Tools to resolve designators.

    One purpose of designators is to bridge between symbolic high-level reasoning and low-level processes.
    Designators get resolved against other datasources, avaible e.g. through ROS topics, services and actions.
    This ROS package contains the resolutions of designators for adapto.

    This includes some PROLOG predicates to hook into CRAM designator resolution, as well as ROS handlers to collect data from ROS.
